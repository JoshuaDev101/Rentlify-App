# Rentlify-App
 A rental management application designed with separate user interfaces for landlords and tenants. 
    Landlords can manage tenants, monitor rental properties, and track payments, 
    while tenants can manage their home details, view and process payments, update profiles, 
    and access other related services. Built with Android Studio for the mobile interface 
    and PHP with XAMPP for backend processing, the system integrates a database for data management 
    and uses Postman for API testing.
